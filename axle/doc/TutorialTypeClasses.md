Type Classes
============

The examples in
["Learn You a Haskell for Great Good"](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
should be expressible with a syntax as similar to Haskell as possible --
but in Scala.
Typeclasses like Functor, Applicative Functor, Monoid, and Monad are modelled explicitely.
(This is similar to the goal of the [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) project.
One exception is that little syntactic details like the order of arguments to "fmap"
are the same as in Haskell.)

Functor
-------


```scala
TODO
```


Applicative Functor
-------------------

```scala
TODO
```

Monoid
------

```scala
TODO
```

Monad
-----

```scala
TODO
```
