Road Map
--------

* logistic regression
* kmeans
* pca

* matrix (context/view bounds | type projections | self type)
* graph family, use self-type
* update readmes

* linear regression: more testing, logging, tuning/vectorization
* fix cross product spec
* plotting
* Matrix: array matrix
* Matrix: muliRow, muliColumn, etc
* Matrix: dependent types for static checks of size constraints on matrix operations?
* Separate Jung and AWT references from core library

* Matrix: lt, gt, etc, should return Matrix[Boolean]
* Matrix: invert
* More tests in specs
* Write tutorial. See

Future versions may include examples of Miles Sabin's work with HList, including his [Shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) project.
