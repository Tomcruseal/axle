A sandbox for experimentation with visual programming/authoring,

It was recently translated into Scala.
The Scala is not yet fully idiomatic.

To Do
-----

* Create executable main
* Re-organize the busy "core" package
* Write tutorial
* Make sense of the class hierarchy (Domain, Value, Form, ScalaForm, ComplexForm, PType, ...)
* Incorporate Scala's "Function" type in the hierarchy (possibly use Scala 2.10's introspection)
