* Clean up GA doc

## 0.4.4 (Summer 2017)
* Remove Spark spoke
* Publish Scala 2.12 artifacts
* Remove Spark impacts on Functor, etc, and just use Cats versions

## 0.4.x (Summer 2017)
* Honor graph vis params in awt graph visualizations
* Fix JodaTime Tics handling of timezones (see TZ requirement in axle.joda.TicsSpec)
* Log scale
* SVG[Matrix]
* `BarChart` Variable width bars
* Horizontal barchart
* `KMeansVisualization` / `ScatterPlot` similarity (at least DataPoints)
* SVG[H] for BarChart hover (wrap with <g> to do getBBox)
* Background box for `ScatterPlot` hover text?
* Fix multi-color cube rendering
* Bloom filter surface

## 0.5.x (Last half of 2017)
* Type-level matrix dimension using `-Yliteral-types` and `singleton-ops` in `LinearAlgebra` typeclass
* Make the `Int` abstract in KMeans{,Visualization}, LinearAlgebra, etc
* Featurizing functions should return HLists or other typelevel sequences in order to avoid being told # features
* Fix logistic regression
