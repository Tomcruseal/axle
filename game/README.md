Game Theory (org.pingel.gametheory)
===================================

As a senior CS major at Stanford in 1996, I did some
independent research with
Professor [Daphne Koller](http://ai.stanford.edu/~koller/) and
PhD student [Avi Pfeffer](http://www.gelberpfeffer.net/avi).

This work spanned two quarters.

The first quarter invovled using Koller and Pfeffer's
["Gala" language](http://ai.stanford.edu/~koller/Papers/Koller+Pfeffer:AIJ97.pdf)
(a Prolog-based DSL for describing games) to study a small
version of Poker and solve for the [Nash equilibria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium).

The second (still unfinished) piece was to extend the
solver to handle non-zero-sum games.

This project is a placeholder.
I'm not sure if I still have any of that work,
but if I do I will put it here and translate it to Scala.
If not, I will try to reconstruct some of it.
The text I was using at the time was
[Eric Rasmusen](http://www.rasmusen.org/)'s
["Games and Information"](http://www.amazon.com/Games-Information-Introduction-Game-Theory/dp/1405136669/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8).
