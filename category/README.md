Category Theory (org.pingel.cattheory)
======================================

I first encountered Category Theory by name when my advisor at UCLA suggested
that some of my interests seemed similar.
At the time I was about five years into a PhD program in computer science with
a major field in programming languages, and minor fields in linguistics and
artificial intelligence.
I never finished that degree, but in the years since then I have come to
realize that Category Theory is in fact an important piece of what I was
looking for.
Now that the pressure of completing a degree is off I am taking my time to
properly learn this subject.

The goal is to have working models of concepts that bear a stong resemblance to
their presentation in the original source material.
Eventually that will mean providing typeset TeX output, as well as other
visualizations for specific data types (such as graphs).

A book on Catheory Theory by Steve Awodey is the portion of this code
that is receiving the most of my attention.
