Category Theory (org.pingel.cattheory)
======================================

I first encountered [Category Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory)
by name when my advisor at UCLA,
[Stott Parker](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~stott/), suggested that some of my interests seemed similar.
At the time I was about five years into a PhD program in computer science with
a major field in programming languages, and minor fields in linguistics and
artificial intelligence.
I never finished that degree, but in the years since then I have come to
realize that Category Theory is in fact an important piece of what I was
looking for.
Now that the pressure of completing a degree is off I am taking my time to
properly learn this subject.

The goal is to have working models of concepts that bear a stong resemblance to
their presentation in the original source material.
Eventually that will mean providing typeset TeX output, as well as other
visualizations for specific data types (such as graphs).

My notes while reading [Steve Awodey](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/)'s book
["Catheory Theory"](http://www.amazon.com/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199237182/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8)
is the portion of this code that is receiving the most of my attention.
