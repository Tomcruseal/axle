This is part of a larger project on source code
search algorithms.

python2json.py will take any python 2.6 (or older)
file and return a json document that represents the
abstract syntax tree.  There are a couple of minor
problems with it, but for the most part it works.

Feel free to submit bug patches to <pingel@gmail.com>.
