Hello!

This is my home for public code that runs on the jvm.

I've got a lot of java code written during grad school in Java
that I'd like to make available here.  This includes basic 
data structures, linguistics theory, and Bayesian networks
code.  I'll try to separate into meaningful sub-units,
all buildable with maven.

I also have some newer code written in Scala that may end
up here as well.
