This is my home for public code that runs on the jvm.

These projects were written in java during grad school.
I also have some newer code written in Scala that may
end up here as well.

At the moment the public projects are:

*************************************
# Linguistics
*************************************

Models the Gold Paradigm and Angluin's Language Learner, which
I encountered in a couple of Ed Stabler's graduate courses
on language evolution.

*************************************
AI
*************************************

Code for Bayesian Networks and Causality.  This codebase
became way too ambitious and entangled with other ideas.
It's currently not buildable.  I may revisit this code
at some point and extract the Bayesian code from the rest
of the "gestalt" stuff, which was where I started to stray
into language design, got interested in bidirectional
program transformations, and then got mired in the desert
of Category Theory.

*************************************
* Util
*************************************

Mostly iterators like PowerSet and CrossProduct that were
interesting to write while learning about Java 5's generics.
The difficulty in expressing the difference between a
DirectedGraph and an UndirectedGraph with Java 5 is one of
the main reason I have gravitated recently to Scala -- its
algebraic data types can properly model this kind of
"family polymorphism".
