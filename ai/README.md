Artificial Intelligence (org.pingel.{bayes,causality,gestalt})
==============================================================

This codebase became way too ambitious and entangled with other ideas.
I am slowly but actively rewriting this stuff in Scala.

Bayesian Networks (org.pingel.bayes)
------------------------------------

See ScalaFigures for example usage.


Causality (org.pingel.causality)
--------------------------------

Do-Calculus, Smoking Model, etc.


Gestalt (org.pingel.gestalt)
----------------------------

Playing with programming language concepts.
It was during this project somewhere around 2005 that the relationship
between programming language design, tools, and bidirectional transformations
started to dawn on me.
Eventually I looked to Category Theory.
I'm still trying to make sense of all the connections.

There's a lot going on inside this project.
Hopefully I can modernize, modularize, and explain some of this later in 2012.
