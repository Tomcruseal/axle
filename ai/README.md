Bayesian Networks and Causality.
This codebase became way too ambitious and entangled with other ideas.
I am slowly but actively rewriting this stuf in Scala.

The "gestalt" stuff is where I went astray.
I became interested in language design, bi-directional
program transformations, and then hopelessly lost
in Category Theory.

With the benefit of a few years' of hindsight, as well as
new language tools (Scala), I plan to extract the core
bayes and causality algorithms from the rest of it.
