==========

Models for a variety of domains including: linguistics,
artificial intelligence, (interactive) data visualization, and Category Theory.
Implemented in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

This project is both an attempt use modern tools to aid the author's own understanding,
as well as an attempt to build tools for other students of these subjects.
I've put some more [background](https://github.com/adampingel/pingel.org/blob/master/Background.md) in a separate document.

These projects are in "pre-alpha" status.
They will likely remain in that state throughout 2012 and probably well beyond that.
Much of the code is undergoing rapid transformation (being rewritten from java, perl, and python).
This status will be updated as the code matures.
No public jars are maintained.

Projects
========

### [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/adampingel/pingel.org/tree/master/ai) (org.pingel.{bayes,causality})

Bayesian Networks and Causality.


### [Axle](https://github.com/adampingel/pingel.org/tree/master/axle) (org.pingel.axle)

An attempt to implement a Haskell-like language as an internal DSL in Scala.
This project also includes useful data structures for graphs and matrices and enrichments to
other standard Scala datatypes.


### [Category Theory](https://github.com/adampingel/pingel.org/tree/master/category) (org.pingel.category)

"A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors."

Early sketch of my reading of a book on Category Theory.


### [Game Theory](https://github.com/adampingel/pingel.org/tree/master/game) (org.pingel.game)

A placeholder project for modelling a range of games and a general model of Game Theory.


### [Gestalt](https://github.com/adampingel/pingel.org/tree/master/gestalt) (org.pingel.gestalt)

A sandbox for experimentation with visual programming and programming language design.


### [Linguistics](https://github.com/adampingel/pingel.org/tree/master/linguistics) (org.pingel.linguistics)

The Gold Paradigm and Angluin's Language Learner.


### [python2json](https://github.com/adampingel/pingel.org/tree/master/python2json)

Takes any python 2.6 (or older) file and return a json document that represents the
abstract syntax tree.
This is part of a larger project on source code search algorithms.
