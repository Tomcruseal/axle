Graphs: Directed and Undirected

Iterators: PowerSet, Permutation

Originally written as exercises to learn about Java 5's generics.
The difficulty in expressing the difference between a
DirectedGraph and an UndirectedGraph with Java 5 is one of
the main reason I have gravitated recently to Scala -- its
algebraic data types can properly model this kind of
"family polymorphism".
